<p>Come bask in the glory of the one, the only, MEME BOT!</p>

<p>Basically it's a bot that takes images submited by users (mainly memes) and then sends that image to a nueral network for analysis, after that's done the bot tells you what the neural network found. Tout fini</p>

<h3>How do you even use this piece of shit?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked, check out the gif below</p>

<p>Yeah it's that easy.</p>
<p>In the above gif I use the command !ma but you can use any of the following "!ma | !memealyze | !Memealyze | !MemeAlyze"</p>
<p>Any questions, comments, suggestions, or otherwise can be posted here on github or sent to me via discord @yugnut#6454</p>
